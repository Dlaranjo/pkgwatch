The team announced the project was 'done' in September 2020, recommending alternatives like Luxon, Day.js, or native Intl. By mid-2020, development had slowed to near-zero but the package remained hugely popular. This is a classic maintenance-mode scenario where the library works but is no longer evolving.",
