In January 2022, Marak deliberately sabotaged the package by publishing an infinite loop in v1.4.1/v1.4.2, protesting lack of compensation for open source work. The warning signs were clear: single maintainer, no releases in over 2 years, no PR activity, despite 20M+ weekly downloads. A textbook bus-factor-of-1 risk.",
