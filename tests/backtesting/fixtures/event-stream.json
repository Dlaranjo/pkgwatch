    "narrative": "event-stream was a popular Node.js stream manipulation library by dominictarr. In September 2018, the maintainer handed off control to a new contributor (right9ctrl) who injected a malicious dependency (flatmap-stream) targeting the Copay Bitcoin wallet. This was discovered in November 2018. The package had a single original maintainer who openly stated he didn't have time to maintain it. A clear case of maintainer abandonment leading to supply chain compromise.",
