    "narrative": "left-pad was a trivial 11-line npm package for left-padding strings. In March 2016, its author Azer Koculu unpublished it from npm after a trademark dispute with Kik messenger. The removal broke thousands of builds including React, Babel, and many other major projects. This exposed npm's fragile dependency model. The package had a single maintainer and was a tiny utility with no meaningful development activity.",
