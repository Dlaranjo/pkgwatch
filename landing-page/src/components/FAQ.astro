  {
    question: "What is predictive package intelligence?",
    answer: "A new approach to dependency management. Instead of waiting for CVEs or breaking changes, we analyze maintainer patterns, community health, and development velocity to predict which packages will cause problems in the future. Security scanners find known issues—we find the ones that haven't happened yet."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes a package 'at risk' before it has vulnerabilities?",
    answer: "Declining commit frequency, contributor attrition, growing issue backlogs, slowing release cadence, and reduced community engagement. These patterns often precede abandonment by 6-12 months. Our scoring model tracks these signals across thousands of packages to identify risk early."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I add this to my toolchain?",
    answer: "After you have security scanning in place. Tools like Snyk and Dependabot handle known vulnerabilities—that's table stakes. PkgWatch adds the prediction layer they don't provide: future risk assessment. Most security-conscious teams use both."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are the predictions?",
    answer: "Our abandonment prediction model achieves a 0.846 concordance index, validated using academic survival analysis methodology. This means our risk rankings correctly order package outcomes 84.6% of the time. See our methodology page for details on how we calculate health scores."
